# Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post

For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Seattle Airbnb Data dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data) found on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the listings in Seattle, including price, location, and reviews.

## Environment

The code was written in Python 3.12 and the following libraries were used:

```python
matplotlib==3.9.2
pandas==2.2.2
seaborn==0.13.2
squarify==0.4.4
statsmodels==0.14.2
```

## Motivation

For this project, I used the Seattle Airbnb dataset to answer the following questions:

1. Property Type Popularity:
   - What are the most popular property types in Seattle?

2. Property Type Pricing:
   - Which Seattle neighborhoods command the highest prices?
   - How do average prices vary by property type and location?

3. Seasonal Trends:
   - When are the peak visiting times for Seattle?
   - How significant are price fluctuations during these periods?
   - Do all property types follow similar seasonal trends?

## Files in the Repository

- `data/`: Contains the Seattle Airbnb dataset.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the analysis.

My analysis was inspired by Airbnb Inside, a series of posts by [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/). I would like to express my gratitude to Airbnb for providing the dataset and serving as a source of inspiration for this project.

## Use of AI Tools in this Project

To enhance the quality of writing in this project, I utilized Grammarly, an AI-powered writing assistant. This tool helped improve the clarity and effectiveness of the text. I believe this use of AI aligns with the project's goals and does not compromise the Honor Code. However, I welcome any feedback on the appropriateness of using such tools in academic work.
