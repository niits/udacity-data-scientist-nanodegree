This repository contains the projects done while pursuing Udacity's Deep Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post

For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Seattle Airbnb Data dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data) found on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the listings in Seattle, including price, location, and reviews.

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline Project

This project is about analyzing disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. The project involves creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that messages can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
